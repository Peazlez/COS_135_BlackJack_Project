Blackjack Game (4 Players)

- Basic Blackjack game with up to four players.  No use of card cases, only basic math for hand totals and ace handling.  Dealer logic hits up to 17 but no more.  Scores are written to Scores.txt post game.

- I utilized text coloring as my something new for this project.  I added text colors to player structs so they would each have individual colors to help differentiate them in the terminal.

- My code is a bit longer than I had anticipated and messier as a result.  Apologies in advance and I will be working to compartmentalize and improve this over the summer just for fun.



How to Play

- make BlackJack 
	- compiles and links all files

- ./BlackJack
	- runs game

- make clean
	- removes all .o files


- The rest of the game is input from user.  Just follow the print prompts and have fun!
